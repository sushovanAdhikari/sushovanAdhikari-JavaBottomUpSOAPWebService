	SOAP Web Service Java 
				 ##

The project is an ongoing progress so I have created this file to push into the master branch. 
The implemented feature will later be merged onto the master branch. 

The WebService is created using SOAP Bottom Up approach, i.e Java --> WSDL

The WebService Project works likes this, 

Req -> EmployeeService -> EmployeeBO -> EmployeeDAO -> OracleDB

The project has property helper class implementing singleton design pattern that contains the environment variables(DB string) and so on. 


The project will first implement a simple getEmployee service to retrieve the employee information and as the work progresses, the project will
implemnt ORM framework(Hibernate) to efficiently map the Employeee object to DB table.
